C function 

Sometimes our program gets bigger in size and its not possible for a programmer to track which peice of code is doing what
Function is a way to break our code into chunks so that it is possible for a programmer to reuse them.

What is function?
A function is a block of code which performs a particular task.A function can be reused by the programmer in a give program  any
number of times

Syntax of function :

function_type<data_type of function> function_name(parameters)
{
    //block of code;
}

Example of function :

void display()//function declaration

----------------------------------------------
{                                            |
    printf("Hi iam display function");       |---------------------->function defination
}---------------------------------------------

int main()
{
    display();//calling function
}

NOTE:
    Before using a function its important that function is declared and defined or else it will declare error

But in case we want to use function later on want to define it later according to our program or maybe we forgot to define a
function block in that case its important that we declare the function first and use the function later.This is known as 
function prototype.

void display();//just declaring a function that is function prototype

int main()
{
    display();//calling function 
    //now display function is not defined but it declared so flow of control or compiler will serach for first function declaration
    //and when found it will serach for it defination
}
//function defination
void display()
{
    printf("hi");
}

I)Function prototype:
Function prototype is a way to tell the compiler about the function we are going to define in the program later on.

II)Function Call:
Function call is a way to tell the compiler to execute the function body at the time  when function call is made .

Note:The program execution starts from the main block or main function in the sequence the instruction  are written .

III)Function defination:
This part contains the exact set of instructions which are need to be excuted during the function call.When a function is called
from main(),the main function falls asleep and gets temporarily suspended.During this time the control goes to the function
being called.When the function is done executing main() block resumes.
