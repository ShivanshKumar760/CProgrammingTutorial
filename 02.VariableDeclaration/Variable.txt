values or object like functionn,variable or structure.

So the rule for naming identifier is same for all :-

and not number or any other special characters.

2.A variable name should only include letters (a-z,A-Z),number or 
underscore no special character like &,(),! etc...

3.Variable are case sensitive ie name is not same as NAME or Name.

4.Keyword ie program reserved words cannot be used as variables.
