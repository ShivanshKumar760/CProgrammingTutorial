A pointer is a variable which stores the address of the another variable

i
[value:72]
address of i:87499----------->we can store adrress of i in variable j:j
                                                                      [87499]
                                                                      address of j:87501


so j is the pointer here ie j points to i

the adrress of-(&) operator  is used to obtain the address of a given variable 

so if we refer :&i --it points to i address ie 87499

Format specifier for printing address is :'%u'

The value of address(*)operator is used to obtain the value present at a given memory address.it is 
denoted by *

*(&i)=72


How To Declare a Pointer:

A pointer is declared using the following syntax:
 int *j;
 j=&i;

ie datatype_of_the_variable_whose_address_is_Stored *variable_name=&variable_whose_address_is_needed;

Just like pointer of type integer ,we also have pointer to char,float etc

int *ptr----points to integer
char *ptr----points to character
float *ptr----points to float
