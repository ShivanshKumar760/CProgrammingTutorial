Sometimes We want to watch comedy videos on youtube if the day is sunday 
sometimes we order junk food if it is our friends birthday 
sometimes we might want to buy an umbrella if its raining and you have the money
you order the meal if dal or your favroite bhindi is listed on the menu.

All above the above are some decisions which depend on a condition being met .
In c language too , we must be able to execute instructions on a condition being met.

Decision Making instruction in C:
->if-else statement or if-else if-else statement
->switch case

I)if - else statement
The syntax of an if-else statement in C looks like;
    if(condition to be checked)
    {
        //if true then this block of code will be executed
        stmt ;
    }
    else{
        //if the condition passed under if() is not true then 
        //this block of code will be executed
    }

    Example:
    int a=23;
    if(a>18)
    {
        printf("You can drive\n");
    }

    NOTE:that else statement is optional it not necessary to add.

II)else if statement 
Instead of using multiple it statements ,we can also use else if along with if thus forming an 
if-else-if block.

if(condition1)
{
    //stmt;

}
else if(condition2)
{
    //stmt;
}
else
{
    //default statement
}

using if-else if-else reduces indents.The last else is optional
Also there can be any number of "else if"

last else is executed only if all conditions fail.

III)ternary operator

condition?expression-if-true ; expression-if-false

IV)Switch case
Switch case is used when we have to make a choice between number and alternative for a given variable

switch (integer value)
{
    case c1:
        code;
    case c2:
        code;
    .
    .
    .
    .
    default:
        code;
}
The value of integer-value is matched against c1,c2...n .If it is match any of these case that case 
along with its code will be executed
