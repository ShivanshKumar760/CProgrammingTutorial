Minimum field width specifier :

Suppose we want to display an output that occupies the minimum number of spaces on the screen.We can achieve this by displaying
an integer number after the percentage sign of the format specifier .

int main()
{
    int x=900;
    printf("%8d\n",x);
    printf("%-8d\n",x);
}

output:
_____900--so o/p should take 8 space to display the number of so since number is already 3 digit it will add 5 space before it
900

Explanation:
In above program ,%8d specifies display the value  after 8 space occupency including the(space and number).While %-8d will make
a value left aligned.

TO fill empty space:

int main()
{
    int x=12;
    printf("%08d\n",x);
}

in above program,%08d means that the empty space is filled with 0.
