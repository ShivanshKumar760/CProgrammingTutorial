format specifier 

format specifier are used to take input and output for specified datatype.They are in string ie double quoted enclosed and They
are also know as format string and determine the format of the input and output.

format specifier                                Detail
1)%d or %i                          it is used to print the signed integer value where signed integer means that the variable
                                    can hold both positive and negative values.


2)%u                                it is used to print the unsigned integer value where unsigned integer means
                                    that the variable can hold only positive value.

                                
3)%x                                it is used to print the hexadecimal unsigned integer value where integer value always 
                                    starts with the 0x value .In this alphabetical character used in hexadecimal notation
                                    are printed in the small letter format such as a,b,c etc.


4)%X                                it is used to print the hexadecimal unsigned integer ,but %X print or take inputs the 
                                    capital  letter alphabets ex:A,B,C as hexadecimal representation.
                                
                    

5)%o                                an octal number integer format specifier that is with base 8 number 

6)%p                                prints the address of the variable (for pointer we use %p)

7)%n                                prints nothing 

8)%hi                               prints short integer number 

9)%hu                               prints short unsigned integer number

10)%f                              it is used to print the decimal floating point number value .By default it prints after(".")

11)%ld                             it is used to print print the long signed integer value.

12)%c                              it is used to print the unsigned character

13)%s                              it is used to print the strings

14)%lf n                           it is used to print the double data type ie large decimal number

15)%Lf                             it is used to print long double data type

16)%e or %E                        used for representing floating point scientific notation.
